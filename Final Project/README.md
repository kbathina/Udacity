The following libraries were used in this analysis:

matplotlib
numpy
re
pandas
string
math
collections
sklearn

The files in the repository include two `.csv` data files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/purumalgi/music-genre-classification), a jupyter notebook, as well as the blog.

The motivation for doing this project is to study patterns in various music genres. My main results are summarized below:

1. The support-vector machine model and the random forest model both performed best in genre classification. 
2. Energy and Acousticeness were two of the most important features.
